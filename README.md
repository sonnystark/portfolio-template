## Objectives:
the goal in this project is to understand and use the knowledge that you got in Back end.

Also to reuse your front end skills that you have learned before.

    - any other pages that you would like to add like(photo gallery page ...).

you should use nodemailer in contact us page so you will get an email if someone wrote a message to you in this page.

you can use any ready template and modify it or you can create your own one.

## extra tasks (not mandatory)

make the website multi language for example (German, English).
